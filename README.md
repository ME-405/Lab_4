This lab conceptualize the way in which interrupts functions while using Queues with an Analog to Digital converter.
A time interrupt has been used in order to analyze the signal provided by such interruption while using a simple RC circuit.
Regarding the RC circuit display below, a capacitor of 4.75 uF was used as well as a 5.95 Kohms and 104 Kohms resistors
